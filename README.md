# National Treasures - Web Application using MERN Stack

We have made an app called National Treasures. It is a way for people to connect with national parks or landmarks by finding a destination that matches with their preferred interests and location. A visitor can search for parks by the state they reside in or directly by their name. This allows for easy use for anyone traveling around the United States or for someone who just wants to take a day trip to a nearby park they haven’t visited yet.

This app also displays activities that are available at each park and keeps track of which activities you have or haven’t finished. If you have an experience that you want to share, there’s also a built-in comment system and blog available. This is where you can see other user’s posts and interact with them by liking or commenting.

When you visit a park’s details page, you can view other user’s comments that may answer some questions you have about the park, or you can just read about their experience instead. You are also able to comment directly under a park that you have visited to provide input on your experience that others may find useful.

Instead of reading the blog comments about the parks, you can also keep up to date with our dynamic news feed. We are constantly pulling up to date news articles from our API to bring you the most current information that can be used to plan your next adventure.
If there’s an article that brings up questions you may have about your next destination park, the article provides a link to the original park that submitted the news story. This is where you can call or email them with your questions. This application is bringing National Parks to the digital age for everyone to enjoy!
