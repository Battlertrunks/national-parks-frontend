            Dream Park is a motivational National Park finder application that
            incorporates a park completion component. Users are able work
            towards "completing" parks by doing activities like hiking, fishing,
            paddling, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to make people more active and go out and see what
            nature is really about. Being active promotes a healthy lifestyle.
            Furthermore, being active is a positive for mental health. Not
            enough people realize the true importance of nature and take it for
            granted at times.
