          <h3>Developer: Alex Sweezie</h3>
          <p>
            Before Covid-19, Alex's field of work was in the the automotive
            industry. He has over five years of experience in automotive
            detailing, classic car repair, and general parts knowledge before he
            entered the tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once quarantine fully began, Alex started to dabble with programming
            in his free time. He mainly worked with code-alongs he found on
            YouTube and started reading into W3schools when he came across an
            issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alex's hobbies mainly revolve around automobiles. In his spare time,
            Alex works on a 1973 BMW 2002 in hopes of restoring it back to its'
            original condition. On other days, he's practicing his skills on the
            track by competing in a production-car class.

          <h3>Developer: Tom Hudak</h3>
          <p>
            After 10 years in the beer brewing and production industry, Tom is
            transitioning from a career as a Brewmaster to a Software Engineer.
            He started the Grand Circus Fullstack JavaScript boot camp and has
            had the opportunity to gain technical experience in JavaScript, HTML
            and CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tom has found working in JavaScript to be equally challenging and
            rewarding. When he started the bootcamp, he didn't realize just how
            deep the rabbit hole went! He looks back at where he came from and
            is proud of his accomplishments thusfar.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his free time, Tom likes to go running, play volleyball, and
            spend time with his wife. He hopes to start a new career in coding
            soon after bootcamp!

          <p>
            Gavin's interest in programming started back in his junior year of
            high school. His coding adventures began with Python but have
            expanded into C++, JavaScript, TypeScript and much more!
          </p>
          <p>
            Gavin mainly works with the MERN stack using TypeScript to create
            responsive web applications. After hours, Gavin hones his skills

            projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            During his free time, Gavin plays with his dog, Mia, and takes her
