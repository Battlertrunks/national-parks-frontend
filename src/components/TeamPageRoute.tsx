          <h3>Developer: Gavin Szczesniak</h3>
          <p>
            Gavin's interest in programming started back in his junior year of
            high school. His coding adventures began with Python but have
            expanded into C++, JavaScript, TypeScript and much more!
          </p>
          <p>
            Gavin mainly works with the MERN stack using TypeScript to create
            responsive web applications. After hours, Gavin hones his skills
            using Frontend Mentor or donating time to his personal programming
            projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            During his free time, Gavin plays with his dog, Mia, and takes her
            on walks around the city. He also spends time with his partner going
            to movies or enjoying the weekend out shopping at local stores.
